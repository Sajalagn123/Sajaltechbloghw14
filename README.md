## Description 

I added the data models for the users, the posts users can create, and the comments users can make in response to the posts.

I imported the data models into the index.js file and established all the realtions between the data models in there.

## Installation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.

## Usage
Users can create posts which will appear on the main dashboard. They can also reply to other user's posts as well. 

## License
None

## Test 
When clicking on the Heroku link, users should be taken to a the main page which has posts from other users. They should be able to create a post when they click on the dashboard button. When they click on another user's post, they should be able to add a comment. Users should also be given the opportunity to update their post when the are in the dashboard.
